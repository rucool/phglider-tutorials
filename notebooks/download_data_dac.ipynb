    "# Downloading pH glider data from the IOOS Glider Data Assembly Center\n",

    "This tutorial shows you how to manually download NetCDF files from the [IOOS Glider DAC](https://gliders.ioos.us/). We have to download the delayed-mode datasets because real-time datasets do not have calculated pH included in the files. pH is calculated in the post-processing and QA/QC process, and those delayed-mode files are submitted to the DAC for public access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will be downloading delayed-mode data from the [spring 2021 deployment of ru30](https://gliders.ioos.us/erddap/tabledap/ru30-20210503T1929-delayed.html). You can browse this ERDDAP data page to get information about the deployment, make some graphs, and download the dataset in a variety of formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, navigate to the main IOOS ERDDAP landing page https://gliders.ioos.us/erddap/index.html and enter the dataset you want to download in the search bar."
